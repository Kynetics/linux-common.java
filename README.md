# linux-common

This java library aims to provide generic tooling for interfacing with linux
utilities via [Java Native Access](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna).
It is meant to build more specific libraries. New classes and functionalities
will be added as specific libraries uncover general patterns and needs.
